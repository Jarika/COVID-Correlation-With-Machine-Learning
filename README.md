# COVID-Correlation-With-Machine-Learning
COVID-19 is a rampant problem because the virus has been spreading globally since January 2020 with no signs of slowing. Individuals experience the virus in varying levels of volatility. Our society would benefit from a tool that shows us correlations between variables such as sex, age, race, etc., and an increasing rate of death in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the goal of this study is to find the correlation between variables such as sex, age, and race/ethnicity and the probability of death within COVID-19 patients.
